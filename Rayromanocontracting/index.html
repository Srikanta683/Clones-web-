      <h2>Jamie Floyd:  Upper West Side Classic 6</h2><br>
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"
      </p>
<br><br>
      <h2>Donna and Scott:  Rescued Renovation</h2><br>
      <p>
        "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"
      </p>
<br><br>
      <h2>David Siegel:  Doubled the Value</h2><br>
      <p>
        "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."
